This project aims to analyze the sales data for the coffee shop to enhance revenue through optimum operational strategy.
The analysis also aims to demonstrate **data cleaning and manipulation skills, various visualization technique** that could be resulted to come up with meaningful insight out of the data .

BUSINESS QUESTIONS : 
**How Total order vary by day of the week :** The busiest day of the week is **Friday**, however in general Monday, Thursday and Friday are the busy days of the week with a total transaction of more than 21500 a day. **Saturday** is the slowest day. Weekend days in general have low transactions

**WHAT ARE PEAK ORDERING HOURS :** **Morning** is the peak transaction time possibly because of the office hours.**10-11 am sees most of the traffic across 3 locations**. The rise in order takes place post 7 am and that continues till 11 am in the morning. From 8am onwards each hour sees around 18K transaction till 11am. **Post 7pm transaction drastically falls down**

**WHAT is the monthly sales trend :** As data shows, after February the Monthly Revenue keeps on rising. This is clearly visible that summer months generate huge revenue due to increased public activities across NYC for the coffee shop

**Best performing categories :** **Coffee** is the highest revenue generating category followed by **Tea**. Branded, Loose Tea, Flavours and Pckgd chocolates together generate only around $37K. The product line within these categories needs to be analyzed and if needed should be removed from the menu to maximize profit for the shop

**WHAT IS THE PRICE RANGE FOR EACH CATEGORY :** Coffee Beans category has the highest max price and Branded has the highest minimum price. On the other hand **high revenue generating categories such as Coffee, Tea have low price range**. Data shows Flavours category has no price variation across its product line

**Top 10 products :** **Barista Espresso is the most revenue generating product** followed by Brewed Chai tea and Hot Chocolate. Brewed Chai tea has the highest transaction followed by Gourmet Brewed coffee and Barista Espresso. Proper inventory needs to be checked and maintained for these poplar products as among 29 unique products only these 10 contribute nearly 80% to the total Revenue

**Is there any exception in top products across locations :** As per analysis the **top products are consistent across the three locations** in NYC. Unlike other two locations , in Astoria Herbal Tea snatched the 5th top position in terms of revenue

**What are slow hours across the stores :** **Post 8pm both Hell’s Kitchen and Lower Manhattan see slow hours in terms of revenue**. Astoria’s revenue is still satisfying even in slow hours.

**WHAT IS THE SALES SCENARIO POST 5 PM ACROSS THE STORE LOCATIONS :** It seems Astoria gets closed between 8 pm. It is visible that even during the closing hours the revenue generation is significantly high. However, both Hell’s Kitchen and Lower Manhattan keeps it open beyond 8pm.

   **RECOMENDATIONS**

**Daily Operational recommendation:** Monday, Thursday and Friday are the busy days of the week. **Inventory management is important during the weekdays**. Saturday and Sunday have low transactions. To increase the footfall, store can come up with **strategy of weekend offers specially in Summers** as summer activity causes rise in sales and transactions.

**Location wise Operational recommendation:** Shop sales, in general is significantly low post 8pm in the evening. As we dig dip, it could be seen that in Astoria shop is closed within 8pm even after having its revenue at peak post 7pm. On the other, it is not profitable to open the shop at Hell’s Kitchen post 8pm and Lower Manhattan post 7pm. Hence the coffee shop should reduce manpower in L. Manhattan and Hell’s Kitchen and reallocate them to **Astoria keeping it open after 7pm in order to improve revenue-profit margin**

**Price Range Adjustment:** Since the top revenue-generating categories (**like Coffee and Tea**) have a low price range, **strategically increasing prices could enhance profitability without significantly impacting sales volume**. This should be done carefully to maintain perceived value.
If the highest-priced item **(Civet Cat)** is not generating enough sales or transactions, it may be wise to **reevaluate its inclusion**. If it's not aligning with customer demand, removing it could free up resources and reduce inventory costs.
For Branded and Pckgd Chocos categories with low revenue and transactions despite a high price range, consider reviewing the product offerings in this category. If they’re not selling, you might want to either lower prices, offer promotions, or discontinue them altogether.

**Menu Card Changes:** Simplifying the menu by **removing** less popular **Flavors and Packaged Chocolates** can streamline operations and reduce complexity, potentially improving customer experience and increasing sales for the remaining items.

**Inventory Management:** **Reducing the variety of products** that aren’t moving can help minimize tied-up capital and **improve profitability**. This is especially relevant for high-cost items that aren’t selling well.
