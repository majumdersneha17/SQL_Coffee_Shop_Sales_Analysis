# SQL_Coffee_Sales_Analysis

# ‚òï Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard  

## üìñ Overview  
We analyzed transaction data for **Maven Roasters**, a fictitious coffee shop with three NYC locations, to derive actionable insights. This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques using **SQL** and **Excel**.

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- üîç Understand sales trends by day, hour, and month.  
- üèÜ Identify top-performing products and categories.  
- üìà Optimize operational efficiency and pricing strategy.  
- üé® Present insights through a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

---

## üìä Data Model  

The dataset contains a single table with transaction data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL**: Data cleaning and transformation.  
- üìë **Excel**:: Interactive visualizations and insights.

- ## üéØ SQL Highlights  

### **Key Queries & Functions**  
The project makes extensive use of advanced SQL techniques, including:  
- **Aggregations:** `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` for revenue, transactions, and price analysis.  
- **Date & Time Functions:** `DAYNAME()`, `MONTHNAME()`, `HOUR()` to analyze trends across time dimensions.  
- **Ranking:** `RANK()` for identifying top products and low-revenue hours across stores.  
- **Window Functions:** `SUM() OVER()`, `RANK() OVER()` for revenue percentage calculations and performance ranking.  
- **CTEs & Views:** Modularized queries for simplifying complex logic, e.g., `Storewise_hourly_sales`.
- 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Database Setup and Data Loading  

### **Step 1: Create the Database and Table**  
Run the following SQL commands to set up the database and table structure in your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB):  

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE COFFEE_SALES;

-- Switch to the created database
USE COFFEE_SALES;

-- Create the table structure
CREATE TABLE coffee_sales_analysis (
    transaction_id INT,
    transaction_date VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_time VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_qty INT,
    store_id INT,
    store_location VARCHAR(50),
    product_id INT,
    unit_price DOUBLE,
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    product_type VARCHAR(50),
    product_detail VARCHAR(50),
    product_size VARCHAR(50),
    CONSTRAINT pk PRIMARY KEY (transaction_id)
);

### Step 2: Loading Data

```bash
# Log in to MySQL
mysql -u [username] -p

# Use the COFFEE_SALES database
USE COFFEE_SALES;

# Load data into the table
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/coffee_sales_data.csv' 
INTO TABLE coffee_sales_analysis 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS 
(transaction_id, transaction_date, transaction_time, transaction_qty, store_id, store_location, product_id, unit_price, product_category, product_type, product_detail, product_size);

### Step 3: Update and Modify Table Data

```sql
-- Convert the transaction_date to proper date format
UPDATE coffee_sales_analysis
SET transaction_date = STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d-%m-%Y');

-- Modify the transaction_time column to TIME data type
ALTER TABLE coffee_sales_analysis
MODIFY transaction_time TIME;


## üìå Key Business Questions  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **How do total orders vary by day of the week?**  
- **Insights:**
  - Friday is the busiest day, followed by Monday and Thursday, each with over 21.5K transactions.

## üìà Recommendations  

1. **üìÖ Daily Operations**  
   - Focus inventory on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.  
   - Introduce summer weekend promotions to boost footfall on slower weekend days.  

2. **üè¢ Location-Specific Changes**  
   - Extend Astoria‚Äôs operating hours beyond 8 PM to capitalize on evening revenue.  
   - Reduce staffing at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Lower Manhattan after 8 PM.  

3. **üíµ Pricing Strategy**  
   - Slightly increase prices for Coffee and Tea to enhance profitability without losing demand.  
   - Reevaluate underperforming high-priced items like Civet Cat Coffee.  

4. **üìã Menu Optimization**  
   - Remove low-performing categories like Flavors and Packaged Chocolates.  
   - Streamline the menu to improve customer experience and reduce inventory complexity.  

5. **üì¶ Inventory Management**  
   - Prioritize inventory for top-performing products (*Barista Espresso*, *Brewed Chai Tea*, etc.).  
   - Reduce stock for slow-moving and high-cost items.
